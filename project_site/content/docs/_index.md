Homelab-flux documentation.

[Infrastructure](./infrastructure/) stores configurations information about the hosts, plans for future architecture, networking and security concerns, and other cross-cutting concerns for the cluster.

[Services](./services/) contains documentation more specific to the services hosted within the cluster. For the most part, this will not duplicate upstream documentation, but will contain informatino about how my systems are configured and deployed.
