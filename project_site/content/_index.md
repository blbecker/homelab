Project site for my flux-powered k8s homelab. There's a symmetric repo for [lower-level](https://github.com/blbecker/homelab-infra) infrastructure and host configuration that my also be of interest. For the time being, most documentation will live here, because I'm in the repo much more often. All homelab documentation will go here, even for those things implemented in the infrastructure repository. I'll add links from that repo to the documentation here to make that more discoverable.
